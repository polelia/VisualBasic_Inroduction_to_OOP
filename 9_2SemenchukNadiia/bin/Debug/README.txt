Description: Program loads a CSV file that contains a list of top 25 sci-fi books 
            (based on crowd-rated list on bestsciencefictionbooks.com) and populates combobox
            with their titles in descending order. If title is selected in the combo box, text boxes are
            authomatically populated with more specific info about selected book. 
            User can add, delete and modify data. You can find all files and images in Bin\Debug folder. 
            If you want to update picture or add a new one - just save one in this folder as BookTitle.jpg.
            I tried to enable uploading through opendialog control but couldn't figure out how to make it save
            selected images or copy them directly into bin/debug folder. 

             I hope you'll enjoy my project. 
             ... And maybe you'll decide to read something from the list :)
