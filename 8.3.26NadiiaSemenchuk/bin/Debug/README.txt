Description: Program loads an XML file that contains a list of top 25 sci-fi books 
             (based on crowd-rated list from bestsciencefictionbooks.com) and displays 
             results of user selections. Also it converts the XML file to CSV format. 
             You can display list in four different ways:
              - title in descending order;
              - author's name in ascending (alphabetical) order;
              - highest number of upvotes (descending);
              - lowest number of downvotes (ascending).
             I hope you'll enjoy it. 
             ... And maybe you'll decide to read something from the list :)
